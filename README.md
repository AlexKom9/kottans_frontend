#GIT

I knew that **Git** is very popular tool for development, but this coursess helped me to learn about **Git** a lot new. **Git** allow you to establish an efficient programming workflow that allows you to: 
	* keep track of multiple versions of a file
	* track bugs by reverting to previous working versions of a file
	* collaborate with other developers on a project.

In these courses, I got practice using *GitHub* to share my changes with others and collaborate on multi-developer projects. I've learned how to make and review a pull request on *GitHub*.

The use of tools like Git and GitHub is essential for collaborating with other developers in most professional environments.
